### Hi! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜Š
My name is Wesley! I love sharing content with the community. I'm currently working on improving my C# and .Net Core knowledge so you be sure to check some stuff out. Additionally you will also find a lot of scripting regarding automation, Azure CSPs and MSPs and other Azure management projects I've been working on.

I'm a big fan of Serverless, AKS, and Platform as a Service. If you've got any questions feel free to reach out and I'll make sure to do my best and help you!
